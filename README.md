# Lab-01
The factorial function is defined to calculate the factorial of a given number n. It uses a recursive approach, where if the number is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1. Otherwise, it calls itself with n-1 and multiplies the result by n to get the factorial.

The user is prompted to enter a number using the input function. The input is converted to an integer using int() and stored in the variable num.

The factorial function is called with the input number num to calculate its factorial, and the result is stored in the variable fact.

The result is printed using the print function. It displays the input number and its factorial.
